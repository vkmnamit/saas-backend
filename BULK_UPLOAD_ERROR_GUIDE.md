Upload a small file (5-10 products) first to ensure format is correct.

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong Column Names
```
Product Name | Cost | Quantity    ← Will fail (wrong headers)
Laptop       | 5000 | 10
```

**Fix**: Use exact column names:
```
productName | price | stock       ← Correct
Laptop      | 5000  | 10
```

### ❌ Price with Currency Symbol
```
productName | price 
Laptop      | ₹5000   ← Will fail (text not number)
```

**Fix**: Remove currency symbols:
```
productName | price
Laptop      | 5000    ← Correct
```

### ❌ Zero or Negative Prices
```
productName | price
Laptop      | 0       ← Will fail (must be > 0)
Mouse       | -500    ← Will fail (negative)
```

**Fix**: Use positive numbers:
```
productName | price
Laptop      | 89999   ← Correct
Mouse       | 599     ← Correct
```
