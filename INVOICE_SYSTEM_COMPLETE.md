## 🚨 Important Notes

### Payment Flow
1. User initiates payment
2. Razorpay processes payment
3. Backend verifies signature
4. Invoice created in MongoDB
5. User redirected to invoice page
6. Analytics automatically updated

### Error Handling

- User sees warning that invoice is pending
- Invoice can be created manually later from backend
- All payment details logged for audit

### Security
- Razorpay signature verification ensures authenticity
- Invoice signatures not exposed to frontend
- User can only access their own invoices (add auth middleware if needed)
